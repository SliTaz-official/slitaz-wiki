====== Cookbook ======

The Cookbook brings together information about the project management, operation and development of the distribution. It talks about creating packages, receipts, the wok, and scripts that start SliTaz.

At the base of the Cookbook is the [[en:scratchbook:start|Scratchbook]], this contains instructions to create your own LiveCD by describing the creation of the first ever public version of SliTaz in March 2007. The Cookbook is modified by the SliTaz community and steadily improved, it provides technical instructions about the project useful to developers and advanced users.
