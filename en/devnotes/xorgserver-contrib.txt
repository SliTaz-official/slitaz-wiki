====== xorg-server-1.8 ======

===== Introduction =====

With xorg-server-1.8, the file ///etc/X11/xorg.conf// is deprecated. Though we can actually reserve it for user modifications, it's no longer edited automatically. 

The configuration files are now in ///etc/X11/xorg.conf.d//. To ensure that the users configuration will not be erased by a system upgrade, here's a suggestion of numbers and content. The configuration files are read in alphanumerical order and their names must end with .conf :

  * 00 - ServerFlag
  * 05 - ServerLayout Tweaks
  * 10 - ServerLayout
  * 15 - Files Tweaks
  * 20 - Files
  * 25 - Modules Tweaks
  * 30 - Modules
  * 35 - InputClass/InputDevice Tweaks
  * 40 - InputClass/InputDevice
  * 45 - Monitor Tweaks
  * 50 - Monitor
  * 55 - Device Tweaks
  * 60 - Device
  * 65 - Screen Tweaks
  * 70 - Screen 
  * 75 - Modes Tweaks
  * 80 - Modes
  * 85 - DRI Tweaks
  * 90 - DRI
  * 95 - Extension Tweaks
  * 100 - Extension

Some of the x0 sections are configured by tazx xorg-config using a template //xorg.conf// file (generated with Xorg -configure). You can find more information about this in the function [[http://hg.slitaz.org/slitaz-tools/file/ca6804d9b56b/tinyutils/tazx#l27|xorg_conf_d]] of tazx. 

If you want add a configuration file to a package, please take care to use a name different from those specified by tazx or this file will be erased when booting in live mode. You can use the same number (x0) with a different name if this configuration doesn't conflict with those used by default. Otherwise, use (x-1)5 for that configuration overwriting the default one.

Examples :

  * [[http://hg.slitaz.org/wok/file/c29991cef110/xorg-xf86-input-evdev/stuff/40-evdev.conf|40-evedev.conf]] - Default configuration for all devices
  * [[http://hg.slitaz.org/wok/file/c29991cef110/xorg-xf86-input-synaptics/stuff/35-synaptics.conf|35-synaptics.conf]] - Advanced configuration for touchpad devices, overwriting the default configuration for these devices
  * hwsetup, section [[http://hg.slitaz.org/slitaz-tools/file/ca6804d9b56b/tinyutils/hwsetup#l685|nvidia]] and [[http://hg.slitaz.org/slitaz-tools/file/ca6804d9b56b/tinyutils/hwsetup#l753|ati]] - Add a file 55-DeviceTweaks.conf configuring a graphic driver other than vesa

===== Configuration files list =====

This avoid naming two files identically, you can use these in the ///etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/readme// for users with the 4.0 release.

tazx :
  * 10-ServerLayout.conf
  * 20-Files.conf
  * 30-Module.conf
  * 40-Keyboard.conf
  * 50-Monitor.conf
  * 60-Device.conf
  * 70-Screen.conf
tazhw :
  * 55-DeviceTweaks.conf
xorg-xf86-input-evdev :
  * 40-evdev.conf
xorg-xf86-input-synaptics :
  * 35-synaptics.conf

===== TODO =====

  * Improve the auto-configuration tool in tazx : some fonts and modules don't need to be loaded by default or don't exist. Some of these elements can be configured by their original package.
  * Pre-configure some drivers to make them work out-of-the-box.
