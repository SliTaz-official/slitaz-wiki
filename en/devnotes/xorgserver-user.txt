===== Upgrade Xorg configuration =====


Upgrade Slitaz :
<code># echo 'y' | tazpkg upgrade</code>
Backup xorg.conf :
<code># mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf-backup</code>
Re-configure Xorg with tazx :
<code># tazx config-xorg</code>

==== User tweaks ====

If you have tweaked the //xorg.conf// file, then you have two possibilities. In both cases the tweaks will be read before the default configuration and will not be erased by an upgrade :

  * Put your modifications (examples) in the file ///etc/X11/xorg.conf.// This file is now reserved for users, it's the first read by Xorg when X boots.

  * You put them in the correct file in the directory ///etc/X11/xorg.conf.d.// SliTaz use two files for each Xorg section : 
          * n0-Section.conf for the default configuration and : 
          * (n-1)5-SectionTweaks.conf for the configurations which overwrite the default one.

Example :

//40-evdev.conf// contains the default configuration for all devices.

//35-synaptics.conf// is installed with the package xorg-input-xf86-synaptics and contains the configuration file for touchpad. It overwrites the default one (evdev).

If you wish to modify this section manually, take care to rename the file with a lower number like //31-MyDevices.conf//. And don't use a file named x5 or x0 to ensure that it will not be overwritten by an upgrade.
