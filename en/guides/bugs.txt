====== BUGS ======

The problems listed in this page refer to the Slitaz 3.0 environment.

===== Burning a CD with Burnbox =====

To burn a CD, you have to be root (it will NOT work from your default TUX account, even if TUX has been added to the cdrom group). 

In Burnbox; enclose the file and folder names between quotes if they contain a space (eg "My Documents"), otherwise it will fail to find the document.

===== Abiword =====

With AbiWord you MUST install glibc-locale too, it was forgotten as a dependency, but it is needed for AbiWord to work properly.

===== Chat entry of the Internet menu =====

This should install pidgin and skype. Practically it has sometimes (but not always) installed pidgin, and always failed to install Skype.
Install Pigin and Skype (well, get-skype) from the package manager.
