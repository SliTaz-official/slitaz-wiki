====== An Application Cannot Find Libraries/Files ======

===== Symptoms =====

  *  When run in a Terminal, an application fails with the message:
<code> [name]: error while loading shared libraries: [library].so.*: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</code>

===== Explanation =====

The program is missing some files it needs to run. This is caused by the package information missing a reference to another, or not including the file.

===== Solution =====

Check if the file required is available in another package. Use the package manager (TazPkg) to search for the file:
  * start the package manager
  * 'Recharge' the package lists, if necessary 
  * click the "Search" tab 
  * in the //Search// box, enter the file-name ([library].so) and click "Files"
  * install the package (pick that with the closest name if there is more than one) by double-clicking the entry and clicking //Install Package//

Alternatively, run the following command from a terminal:
<code>tazpkg search-pkgname library.so</code>


... and install the appropriate package with:
<code> tazpkg get-install [package] </code>

If no packages are given, report this as a bug over at the [[http://labs.slitaz.org|Labs]] as it needs to be included, or the dependency removed during the build.
