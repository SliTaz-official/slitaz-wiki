====== Cannot Login to Desktop ======

===== Symptoms =====

  * Slim, the SliTaz Login Manager, fails with the message:
<code> failed to execute login command </code>

<note warning>Verify the SliTaz install partition is not full and formated with a linux filesystem such as ext3.
Using fat32 or ntfs filesystems cause login failure.</note>
===== Explanation =====

The following files must exist, this can be verified with the ''ls -la'' command:
  * .Xdefaults
  * .xinitrc
  * something else?

===== Solution =====
You should copy the default files from the template located in the /etc/skel directory. This happens automatically when a new user is created with the SliTaz Control Box, but not when using the command-line utilities. Occasionally users experience these files being removed or modified/broken.

Switch to the root (super) user:
<code> su root </code>
Change to the affected users /home directory:
<code> cd /home/USERNAME </code>
Set the shell options to allow the dot (.) to be included in file names:
<code> shopt -s dotglob </code>
Copy all files, recursively:
<code> cp -r /etc/skel/* /home/USERNAME </code>
Change ownership of all files and directories in the user's home to that of the affected user:
<code> chown -R USERNAME:USERGROUP /home/USERNAME/* </code>
Restore the shell options:
<code> shopt -u dotglob </code>
The essential files should now be restored!

EDIT:

<code> shopt -u dotglob </code>
is not working in slitaz-3.0.iso - instead of this run in addition:
<code> chown -R USERNAME:USERGROUP /home/USERNAME/.[a-zA-Z0-9]*</code>
