===== I can't change the mouse for left-handed people =====

=== Symptoms ===
I can't change the mouse for left-handed people using the computer.
 
=== Explanation ===

You need to install the ''xorg-xmodmap'' package to configure the mouse buttons.

=== Solution ===

Install the ''xorg-xmodmap'' package. In a terminal, type:
  # tazpkg -gi xorg-xmodmap

To configure the mouse for left-handed:
  # xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"

To configure the mouse for right-handed:
  # xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3"

To check the configuration of your mouse:
  # xmodmap -pp

To make the changes permanent for your user, create a new file called ''xmodmap.desktop'' in the ''~/.config/autostart'' directory with the following content:
<file>
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Left hand mouse
Exec=xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"
NotShowIn=XFCE;Razor;LXDE;
</file>

Logout and Login to X session and the mouse buttons are configured for left-handed people. 

To make the changes permanent for all users at the same time, repeat the procedure above as //root//, creating a new ''xmodmap.desktop'' file in the ''/etc/xdg/autostart'' directory.
