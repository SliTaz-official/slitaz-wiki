XTerm — Cannot Copy/Paste
=========================


Overview
--------

There are a variety of terminal emulators available for SliTaz and even more for Linux.
SliTaz comes with the venerable :program:`XTerm`, a basic but functioning program.

.. tip::
   You may experience some problems with any graphical program, some more serious than others.
   By running them via a Terminal, any output will appear in the Terminal window so you can identify any problems.
   Just find its command, type it and press :kbd:`Enter`.


Symptoms
--------

* I cannot find the copy/paste feature
* Right-click for a menu does not work as expected


Explanation
-----------

:program:`XTerm` does not have a right-click menu — or any other menu for that matter — but selection is activated by using the mouse buttons.


Solution
--------

Selection, copy and paste is achievable using the mouse buttons.
The three mouse buttons works thus:

* *left click* defines where the selection begins
* *middle click* defines where the selection ends & copies it to clipboard
* *right click* pastes the clipboard contents to the current cursor, not mouse, position
