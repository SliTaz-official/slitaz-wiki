====== XTerm ======

===== Cannot Copy/Paste =====

=== Symptoms ===
  * I cannot find the copy/paste feature
  * Right-click for a menu does not work as expected
 
=== Explanation ===

XTerm does not have a right-click menu -- or any other menu for that matter -- but selection is activated by using the mouse buttons.

=== Solution ===

Selection, copy and paste is achievable using the mouse buttons. The three mouse buttons works thus:

  * //left click// defines where the selection begins
  * //middle click// defines where the selection ends & copies it to clipboard 
  * //right click// pastes the clipboard contents to the current cursor, not mouse, position
