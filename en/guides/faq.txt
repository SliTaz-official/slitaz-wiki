====== Frequently Asked Questions ======

Listed here are the most frequently asked questions from the user forums. Please check here to see if your problem has been fixed before starting a new forum thread.

These are organised into per-scenario groups - from  system-level through to the desktop. Within each, a symptom describes a give-away identification of the problem; a widely-working solution is then outlined.

===== Questions Still Unanswered? =====

No problem! We are happy to hear your question over at our [[http://forum.slitaz.org/|Support Forum]] -- or even the [[http://www.slitaz.org/en/mailing-list.html|Mailing List]] if it is a more lengthy discussion -- once you have looked through our [[http://doc.slitaz.org/en:start|documentation]]!

Answering questions takes time however, to answer them well slightly longer. This time could be better spent for other necessary things, like improving SliTaz or writing documentation.

** Your first post should include the following things: **

  * detailed information about your hardware
    *  e.g the manufacturer and model of your computer, motherboard or (even better) detailed chip information. The latter can be found by running the following command and uploading the generated //SysInfo.txt// file:
 
<code>
echo '=== PCI Devices: ===' >> SysInfo.txt && lspci >> SysInfo.txt && echo '=== USB Devices: ===' \ 
>> SysInfo.txt && lsusb >> SysInfo.txt && echo '=== Kernel Modules: ===' >> SysInfo.txt && lsmod >> SysInfo.txt
</code>

  * precise information about your SliTaz installation:
    *  which version to you have? Stable or Cooking?
    *  are you using the standard ISO or a specific flavor (XVESA, Lo-RAM etc.)?
    *  is it installed on a HD or on an USB stick?
    *  do you know which file-system you used?

  * identify when your problem appeared:
    *  was it just after installation or after an update?
    *  were there any changes to your normal usage pattern or configuration?

This should provide enough system information for help to be provided.
