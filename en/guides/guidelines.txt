===== General Instructions =====
  * **Add** : Feel free to add any pages to the wiki  
    * __Namespaces or Documentation Hierarchy__ : Documentation Hierarchy structure has been defined for the English language. Please follow it as a standard while creating pages.  Some examples :
      * //en:handbook:start// : Handbook start page
      * //en:handbook:desktop// : Desktop is a page link on the handbook start page. All handbook pages should have the namespace "en:handbook:" 
      * //en:guides:faq// : All guides pages should have namespaces "en:guides". To create a faq page, simply do <nowiki> [[faq | FAQ]] </nowiki>. This will automatically create a faq page with the en:guides:faq namespace
      * //Index// : Links can be used to see the hierarchy structure
    * __Add Images__ : Use the toolbar and add images to the relevant namespaces
  * **Delete** : Simply remove all the contents of the pages to delete a page
  * **Review** :  Each page should contain a review section. For example, [[http://doc.slitaz.org/guidelines#formatting|see the bottom of this page]]. A review section is just a wiki table. You are free to edit the table and/or add extra rows to the table. You can translate it into your own language. You can also copy and paste the page review table on this page to any of the wiki pages and edit accordingly

===== Page Layout  =====

There are some definite styles of pages to which we can bring a consistent layout. 

=== FAQ ===

This applies to one page, [[en:guides:faq|Frequently Asked Questions]].

  - **Error Message** - title the individual FAQ with the most likely description, usually the error message displayed.
  - **Symptoms** - a brief description of what the user may experience when this FAQ applies. There may be more than one. Use correct formatting when describing on-screen messages, keystrokes etc. Hopefully, Google results will pick this up.
  - **Explanation** - a not-very-technical explanation of the error message. Users will be able to understand the problem and how it can be resolved in a high-level sense.
  - **Solution** - how to solve the problem, technically. Include brief descriptions of the steps needed rather than merely a list of commands; this is important to understand what the user needs to do. Individual problems have slightly different solutions -- use levels of bullet points etc. to organise it.


=== Guides ===

These resides under the <lang>:guides:<topic> name-space. They describe a process to get something working.

  - **Introduction** - Summarize the article  
  - **Graphical Way** 
     * Instructions - How to use the graphical tool (if it exists) 
     * Screenshots - A picture is worth a thousand words
  - **Manual Way**
     * Installation - Define the packages required and how to install them 
     * Configuration - Explain how to configure files for the proper functioning of packages 
     * Summarize - If possible, summarize all commands in one single script for troubleshooting
  - **Examples and Tips** - Add some examples and advanced tips
  - **FAQ/Troubleshooting** - Some DIY instructions or a sub-section on problems/symptoms/solutions/notes or a link to forum posts. Link to FAQ if answered there
  - **References** - Other good reference material on the Internet. If there aren't any, consider a message asking for some!


=== Handbook ===

These reside under the <lang>:handbook:<topic> namespace. They brief the reader on what SliTaz can offer on a particular topic. They are an overview and description and not a guide, though they may contain (very) few steps on how to get up-and-running.

  - **Blurb** - describes the content of the page, in terms of scope.
  - **Topic** - what the user expects to achieve, e.g. 'Image Processing' or 'Desktop Themes'
  - **Body Text** - an overview of the topic, with links to relevent Guides or external web pages.
  - **Tips** (optional) - any problems the user may experience. Link to FAQ if answered, forum posts, good problem-solving web pages etc.

===== Formatting =====

Please use correct formatting wherever possible. It aids readability and often lessens ambiguity between commands that should be entered vs. output etc.

  * Learn wiki syntax [[http://doc.slitaz.org/wiki:syntax?s[]=playground | here]]. For testing wiki syntax, just use the [[http://doc.slitaz.org/en:guides:playground| Playground]] page
