LiveCD
======

:author: seawolf, brianperry

This manual is intented to help you on making a SliTaz LiveCD.
Once you made a customized SliTaz ISO, or after simply having downloaded a regular SliTaz ISO from the SliTaz website, you can go ahead and burn it to a CD.
However, as the writer of this guide has found, not all programs always work.
So here's a list of programs that are found not to work:

* :program:`Nero Burning ROM 6` (Windows)

These programs do work:

* :program:`imgBurn` (Windows, or Linux using Wine)
* :program:`ISO Master` (Linux; should work, `see here <isomaster_>`_)
* :program:`Graveman` (Linux; should work, `see here <mkiso_>`_)
* :program:`k3b` (Linux)
* :program:`wodim` (Linux)
