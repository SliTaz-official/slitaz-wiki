This page describes how to make a slitaz live usb stick.

===== From Windows =====

A SliTaz Live USB installation can be performed using:
  * [[http://www.linuxliveusb.com/|LinuxLive USB Creator]]
  * [[http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/|Universal USB Installer]]
  * UnetBootin
  * TazUSB

<note warning>
**SliTaz with xorg-server and persistent /home requires a linux filesystem (ext2,ext3) for regular users to login to an X-session.**

**Fat32 or NTFS filesystems cause slim login manager error:** //Failed To Execute Login Command// </note>

<note tip>__//Solution://__ \\
**SliTaz runs in RAM so after booting it no longer needs the flash drive.** \\
**This enables you to reformat the flash drive to a linux filesystem and reinstall SliTaz.** \\ </note>

  - Install SliTaz with [[http://www.linuxliveusb.com/|LinuxLive USB Creator]] or [[http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/|Universal USB Installer]] \\
  - Copy the slitaz.iso to the root of the flash drive. \\
  - Boot into SliTaz with the flash drive,login root, password: root \\
  - [[http://doc.slitaz.org/en:handbook:commands|Mount]] the flash drive,copy the slitaz.iso to /root \\
  - Use **From SliTaz** instructions above to format the flash drive ext2, reinstall SliTaz using ISO file as install source.


<note warning>**Tazusb.exe and Unetbootin do not work with any cooking.iso, rolling.iso or slitaz-4.0.iso (core 4-in-1)** .

They will work with [[http://mirror.slitaz.org/iso/4.0/flavors/slitaz-4.0-core.iso|slitaz-4.0-core.iso]] or another single rootfs.gz flavor found [[http://mirror.slitaz.org/iso/4.0/flavors/|here]].</note>

<note warning>**Tazusb.exe does not work with any cooking.iso, rolling.iso or slitaz-5.0.iso**.

The .iso file must be renamed to an .exe file, i.e.:

    * boot into windows,
    * download the latest slitaz-rolling.iso,
    * go to the downloaded file directory,
    * rename the file slitaz-rolling.iso to slitaz-rolling.exe,
    * double-click on the file slitaz-rolling.exe to run it,
    * follow the instructions given by the application (2-3 steps):
    *- Do you want to create a boot key: => answer yes,
    *- Step 1: unplug the USB stick,
    *- Step 2: plug the USB stick in and wait for Windows to mount it,
    *- wait for the confirmation window,
    * reboot,
    * press Fn key to choose alternative boot device, slitaz boot panel must be displayed,
    *- select the language,
    *- RETURN to boot.
</note>



====== Remarks when using UNetbootin ======
You can find UNetbootin for Windows at [[http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/unetbootin-windows-latest.exe|this page]]. Note that you need to select SliTaz ISO from the Distribution list in unetbootin. To create a Live USB, select “USB Drive” under installation type.
You can also choose to do a frugal install. To perform a Frugal Install, select “Hard Disk” under installation type.

====== Remarks when using TazUSB ======
The binary file **TazUSB.exe** is a Windows executable that installs an ISO file on a USB drive. \\
  * download TazUSB executable for Windows: [[http://mirror.slitaz.org/packages/windows/tazusb.exe|tazusb.exe]] (the sources are available here [[http://hg.slitaz.org/tazusb/raw-file/tip/win32/tazusb.nsi|tazusb.nsi]])
  * plug in your USB drive and format it in **FAT32** (formatting might not be required),
  * launch TazUSB application by double-clicking on **TazUSB.exe** executable file,
  * choose the language,
  * select the destination USB drive (**double-check that the letter refers to the correct drive**),
  * select the SliTaz **iso**

===== From Linux =====
====== From any Linux distro ======
* You can use unetbootin; download from [[http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/unetbootin-linux-latest|here]].

====== From Slitaz linux ======
Download > Burn > Boot a SliTaz ISO image

**__//Verify the install target, format will delete everything.//__** 
<code>
$ su root
# fdisk -l
# tazusb format /dev/sdxx
</code>

**//LiveCD as install source//**
<code>
# tazusb gen-liveusb /dev/sdxx
</code>

**//Iso file as install source//**
<code>
# tazusb gen-iso2usb slitaz.iso /dev/sdxx
</code>

Note that the /dev/sdxx part of the command above specifies the location to where you need to write the iso's files to; it is not the source media where the iso is on ! With the iso file as install source option, you should hence specify the exact location where the slitaz iso  source file is located. If it is located at /home/tux (while running slitaz from a non-live version), write "tazusb gen-iso2usb /home/tux/slitaz.iso /dev/sdxx". If the source file is found on an external hard disk, mention the folder in which the media's files are outputted to - check this with PCManFM (in practice the folder can be something like /media/disk). So, the command you'd need to write with the latter would be something like "tazusb gen-iso2usb /media/disk/slitaz.iso /dev/sdxx"

Once done, wait… and then reboot!

===== SliTaz 4.0 kernel panic (not booting) =====
In Slitaz 4.0 the rootfs file is divided into 4 parts which is a problem with tazusb.exe and UNetbootin. For SliTaz to work with tazusb.exe and Unetbootin you must download the [[http://mirror.slitaz.org/iso/4.0/flavors/slitaz-4.0-core.iso|core flavor of SliTaz]] consisting of a single file rootfs.
