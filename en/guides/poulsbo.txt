====== Poulsbo (aka GMA500) ======

This is a short guide on getting the Poulsbo graphics working nicely with SliTaz 4.0 or new rolling-core

Boot SliTaz and establish a working network connection. 
After a successful installation you will need to do the following steps to get the graphics working:

<code># nano /etc/rcS.conf</code>
Look for the row called LOAD_MODULES and remove poulsbo from the list, also make sure that psb_gfx is present.

Then remove VESA and add the psb_gfx module (which is inside the linux-staging package):
<code># tazpkg remove xorg-xf86-video-vesa 
# tazpkg recharge
# tazpkg get-install linux-staging</code>

The fbdev-driver needs to be installed/updated:

<code># tazpkg -gi xorg-xf86-video-fbdev</code>

Simply reboot and the graphics should work nicely with the correct resolution.
