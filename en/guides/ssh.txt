====== Dropbear SSH ======

Dropbear is a small SSH server and client written by Matt Johnston

https://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html

By default SliTaz will not start the SSH server at boot. To be launched automatically, dropbear must be added to the variable RUN_DAEMONS in the /etc/rcS.conf file.
(Normally Dropbear logs in /var/log/messages, but in SliTaz it logs in /var/log/auth.log)
