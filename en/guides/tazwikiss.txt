====== TazWiKiss ======

===== Introduction =====

TazWikiss is a port of the wiki software [[http://wikiss.tuxfamily.org/|WiKiss]].
As it is a CGI application, it needs a web server supporting CGI and a browser -
on SliTaz these are by default httpd (in busybox) and tazweb.
The CGI scripts are shell scripts, so no other language interpreter is needed.

The software is installed in ''/var/www/wiki'' and the wiki pages are (by definition in
the config file: ''/var/www/wiki/config.sh'') stored in ''/var/www/wiki/pages''.

The wiki pages are plain text files without any subdirectory hierarchy.

===== Requirements =====

A running web server supporting CGI and a web browser.

===== Start TazWiKiss =====

==== via a desktop menu ====
-> Accessories -> Wiki documents

==== via a command ====
  $ tazweb http://localhost.wiki.index.sh
When logged in on the same system where the web server is running, else localhost is to be replaced
by a name or IP address of the system where the wiki resides.

===== Installation =====
When TazWiKiss is not incorporated in the flavor you installed, you can add it by installing 
the package ''slitaz-dev-tools'':
  # tazpkg -gi slitaz-dev-tools

===== Hints =====

==== Help on wiki syntax ====

Help on the syntax is available from the welcome page of the delivered wiki by hyperlink ''help'' or ''helptable''.

==== Hide wiki pages ====

To hide pages, the user can set a password on the page by inserting
  {PASSWORD=read-password}

==== Protection of wiki ====

To prevent unauthorised users from modifying the wiki, a password can be set in
''/var/www/wiki/config.sh'' (or a language specific configuration file) by replacing
''PASSWORD=""'' with ''PASSWORD="modification-password"''.
