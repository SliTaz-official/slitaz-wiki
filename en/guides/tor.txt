====== The Tor Installation Guide ======

This guide allows you to use the anonymous TOR network with most web browsers and command line tools such as wget. Begin by installing TOR:

<code>
# tazpkg get-install tor
# tazpkg get-install privoxy
# echo 'forward-socks5t /        127.0.0.1:9050   .' >> /etc/privoxy/config
# sed -r '/RUN_DAEMONS/s/(" *)$/ privoxy\1/' -i /etc/rcS.conf 
# /etc/init.d/privoxy start
</code>

You can use Vidalia to start and configure tor, the proxy server is launched automatically when the SliTaz system boots. Once installed, you will find Vidalia in the Menu -> Internet. To configure preferences via the proxy server with the following values: Proxy address: **127.0.0.1** Port: **8118** and the path to the configuration file: **/home/USER/.config/torrc** (changing USER by User name).

<code>
# tazpkg get-install vidalia
# exit
$ cp /etc/tor/torrc ~/.config
</code>

Use Bridges to get tor working if the above options are not working.

<code>
# echo '
UseBridges 1
UpdateBridgesFromAuthority 1
bridge 66.160.141.98:6085 ' >> ~/.config/torrc
</code>


===== Verification and Advice =====

For more added security; do not launch TOR via the 'root' user, Vidalia is perfect for this (or the command line). To check your current browser with TOR: https://check.torproject.org/
