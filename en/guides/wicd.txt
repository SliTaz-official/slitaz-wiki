====== WICD ======

[[http://doc.slitaz.org/en:guides:network-script|Pankso's openbox treat]] is very close to WICD, but if you want to set up SliTaz for not very experienced users it's recommended that you use WICD for Wireless Internet Control.

Do as root:

<code># tazpkg get-install wicd
# leafpad /etc/rcS.conf</code>

In ///etc/rcS.conf// remove from the section RUN_SCRIPTS: **network.sh**
and add to the section RUN_DAEMONS: **wicd**

Then as user:

<code>$ leafpad .config/openbox/autostart.sh</code>
And add to the end:

<file># wicd Network Configuration
wicd-client &</file>

Then remove the network-plugin from the LX-Panel by right clicking on the network-plugin. 

Reboot - don't test before rebooting, because network.sh is interfering with WICD (even if you stop it by typing /etc/int.d/network.sh stop).
