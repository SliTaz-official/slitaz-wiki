====== Xbindkeys ======

===== Introduction =====


Xbindkeys is a program that allows you to launch shell commands with your keyboard or your mouse under X Windows. It links commands to keys or mouse buttons using a configuration file. It's independent of the window manager and can capture all keyboard keys (ex: Power, Wake...).
 
It is handy to make "dead keys" of a multimedia keyboard work. (ex: play, pause, browser homepage...)

----

===== Installing =====

Use //tazpkg// to quickly install //xbindkeys// package. Open a terminal as //root// and type:

  # tazpkg get-install xbindkeys

----

===== Configuration and detecting key codes =====

Xbindkeys uses a configuration file to link a command to a key on your keyboard. Usually this file is : ''$HOME/.xbindkeysrc''

You can have a default one created by using :

  $ xbindkeys --defaults > $HOME/.xbindkeysrc

Start the program using:

  $ xbindkeys

To add a custom keyboard shortcut, first you have to detect the key code. To do this, use:

  $ xbindkeys -k

When a small white window shows up on screen, just press the desired key. Terminal will show you the 3-line code of the pressed key. Example:

  "(Scheme function)"
  m:0x10 + c:180
  Mod2 + XF86HomePage

Now, close ''xbindkeys'' application to make changes on configuration file:

  $ killall xbindkeys

Open ''.xbindkeysrc'' file on Leafpad (or on your favorite text editor) and copy the 3-line code above to the end of the file.
We need to change the first code line to link the key code to a desired function. For example, if we want to open Midori when ''XF86Homepage'' key is pressed, we must change the first line to:

  "midori"
  m:0x10 + c:180
  Mod2 + XF86HomePage

Save and close the ''.xbindkeysrc'' file. Restart ''xbindkeys'' program and your new shortcut is already working!
To add other shortcuts, repeat the procedure above.

If you want to detect a multi-key shortcut code like CTRL+F, use:

  $ xbindkeys -mk


==== Summary ====
Summary of commands:

  # tazpkg get-install xbindkeys
  $ xbindkeys --defaults > $HOME/.xbindkeysrc
  $ xbindkeys
  $ xbindkeys -k
  $ killall xbindkeys
  $ leafpad HOME/.xbindkeysrc
  $ xbindkeys

==== Adding xbindkeys in autostarted applications ====

In the //PCManFM// in your //home// folder search for hidden folder //.config//, open it, next open //openbox// folder and open //autostart.sh// in your text editor. Add these lines at the end of your file:

  # Fn Keys
  xbindkeys &

Save and quit text editor. All custom shortcuts will stay after you reboot or switch off/on your machine.

===== Examples and tips =====
This section shows you many command codes ready to use. Key codes (last two of 3-line key code) may vary from keyboard to keyboard, so it's up to you to catch them using //xbindkeys//.

=== Volume control (Alsa mixer) ===

  #Muter/UnMute
  "amixer set "Master" toggle"
  m:0x00 + c:121
  XF86AudioMute

  #Volume up
  "amixer set "Master" 5%+"
  m:0x0 + c:123
  XF86AudioRaiseVolume

  #Volume down
  "amixer set "Master" 5%-"
  m:0x0 + c:122
  XF86AudioLowerVolume

=== Alsaplayer ===

  #stop alsaplayer
  "alsaplayer --pause"
  m:0x0 + c:172
  XF86AudioPlay

  #next alsaplayer
  "alsaplayer --next"
  m:0x0 + c:171
  XF86AudioNext

  #previous alsaplayer"
  "alsaplayer --prev"
  m:0x0 + c:173
  XF86AudioPrev

=== Midori Browser ===

  #Open Midori at Homepage
  "midori --execute Homepage"
  m:0x10 + c:180
  Mod2 + XF86HomePage

  #Back for previous page
  "midori --execute Back"
  m:0x10 + c:166
  Mod2 + XF86Back

  #Forward to next page
  "midori --execute Forward"
  m:0x10 + c:167
  Mod2 + XF86Forward

  #Stop loading current page
  "midori --execute Stop"
  m:0x10 + c:136
  Mod2 + Cancel

  #Reload/Refresh current page
  "midori --execute Reload"
  m:0x10 + c:181
  Mod2 + XF86Reload

NOTES: If you use Firefox or Google Chrome, there's no need to modify //xbindkeysrc// file: these browsers automatically recognize the multimedia keys.
Also, if you change from Midori to Firefox or Chrome, you must comment (#) or delete the shortcuts above. If you don't do this, it will open a Midori window when you press a navigation button.

=== Power management ===

  #suspend to ram
  "sudo pm-suspend"
  m:0x0 + c:150
  XF86Sleep

NOTE: this one (suspend to ram) works if you install //pm-utils//.

  #power off button
  "poweroff"
  m:0x0 + c:124
  XF86PowerOff

=== Screenshots ===

  #screenshot
  "mtpaint -s"
  m:0x0 + c:107
  Print

=== Applications Menu (Start Menu) ===

  #Show Start Menu with left windows-key
  "lxpanelctl menu"
  m:0x50 + c:133
  Mod2+Mod4 + Super_L

  #Show Start Menu with right windows-key
  "lxpanelctl menu"
  m:0x50 + c:134
  Mod2+Mod4 + Super_R
