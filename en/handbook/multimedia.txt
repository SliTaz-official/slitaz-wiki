====== Multimedia ======

===== SliTaz sound and video =====

SliTaz LiveCD mode provides sound support, but no video player, however you can watch YouTube by installing the get-flash-plugin package. To watch videos you can use Xine, it supports most formats such as avi, mov, mpeg, etc. Note Xine can also act as an audio player. At the sound level, you have a mixer (alsamixer) and audio player (alsaplayer), both installed by default on the standard LiveCD. SliTaz also provides tools to configure your sound card.

===== Configure the sound card =====

In LiveCD mode SliTaz automatically configures the sound card by launching a dialog. In most cases the sound card is instantly recognized and you just press ENTER to continue to login and have your sound working. However, sometimes your card is not recognized at startup or simply not supported. Before throwing in the towel, you can try to manually configure your card by asking for help on the mailing list or on the hardware support forum.

=== Soundconf ===

To configure or reconfigure a sound card, SliTaz provides a script (soundconf), this utility is used at startup and doesn't pose any questions, supports the right modules and automatically configures ///etc/rsS.conf// so that the right driver is loaded on each start. Soundconf will also automatically adjust volume levels, you can change the settings later through the mixer and alsactl. To start the sound configuration interface, you must have administrator priviledges and type:

<code> # soundconf </code>

=== Alsactl ===

Alsactl controls alsa and can store settings or restore sound for example, to retain preferences for each start. When configuring sound with soundconf, volumes are automatically adjusted. You can use alsamixer as root to change the values and then launch alsactl to store the configuration.

First, start alsactl:

<code> # alsactl init </code>

Then use alsamixer to set up sound levels according to your preferences (you can find them at //Applications// menu --> //Multimedia//). Lastly, use alsactl again to store your preferences:

<code> # alsactl store </code>

To restore the configuration you can use the alsactl restore command or to restore your preferences at each system startup you can edit /etc/init.d/local.sh with your favorite text editor or simply 'echo' the changes:

<code> # echo 'alsactl restore' > /etc/init.d/local.sh </code>

===== Alsamixer =====

Alsamixer is the official mixer of the Alsa project. It is simple and effective and can be run from the menu or directly from a terminal. The volumes can be regulated with the up/down arrows or muted using the m key. To start from a Linux terminal:
